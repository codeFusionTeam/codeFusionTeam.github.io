# How to edit:

If you'd like to create a new repository, please select the button titled "Upload Files."  Then, drag the folder and files that your project contains.  To see the live version of your project, go to "codefusionteam.github.io/NAME OF YOUR FOLDER/NAME OF FILE"  

By default, GitHub will look for an index.html file in your folder if you just go to "codefusionteam.github.io/FOLDER" and you do not specify a file to go to.

For instance, to see my live code, you would go to "codefusionteam.github.io/testingAPIs"
